When I publish notes with Github pages, I have many theme options with Jekyll templates provided by Github, and also github projects.

I intended to be simple. it makes no sense to decorate the pages with many buttons and pictures.
The most important are the content files in _posts folder, which i need to provide.


I selects two simple themes:

1. one is [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme, this is for my daily note. it is quite old, but it is flexible enough. I adapt this a little and make [my own](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)put the script codes functions with custom-head.html, such as katex, or mermaid. it is also easy for me to <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> the jekyll liquid codes and make my own layout and pages.

1. another is the [minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) theme. i use [this theme](https://github.com/godalming123/minimal) for single page project and my github profile. which support dark and auto colors.

focus on content, and stay with a format.
